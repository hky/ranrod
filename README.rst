 RANROD
========

RANROD is a router config differ and collector inspired by RANCID_. While RANCID_
is a cool product, it just lacks the flexibility and ease of extending it for
other purposes than grabbing Cisco configurations. Also, it's mostly written in
Perl and Bash, compiled into a giant pile of seperate scripts to do a relative
easy job. RANROD intends to be more flexible, yet easier to maintain and use.
